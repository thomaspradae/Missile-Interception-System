I spent a few days trying to find ways to open this log: AI's impact on warfare, empirical tips on project management, and so on. Just to realize it's beside the point. A log is ancillary work, the veggies, not the meat. In other words, if all we can log is that we're writing a log, we're doing something wrong.
