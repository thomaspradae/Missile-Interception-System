# Missile interception system - LOG

## JULY 2025
**July 10**
<br>
I've been working on this project for quite some time, since right about the end of 2023, as war brewed in Ukraine, the Middle East, and elsewhere. This upsurge of conflict in the public eye ran in tandem with the rise of consumer AI, which leads to a very simple question: if war and AI are here to stay, when, where and how will they intersect each other? That and I wanted to learn reinforcement learning. 
<br>

So I started building a missile interception simulator from scratch. I didn't know what an env was, I'd barely heard a bit of [David Silver's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0) RL lectures and AlphaGo. I just picked a problem and threw myself at the mercy of God and the old adage 'if you can model it, you can solve it'. 

A lot can be said about the "soft" side of the project, but in order to avoid making this into a motivational/productivity porn post, I'll summarize my sins concisely as follows:

- The project was left untouched for months (multiple times), so, if mutually exclusive, optimize for repeated daily action vs 2 all-nighters every few months. 
- Logging might seem tedious while working, but in retrospective, gives a great idea of the current state of the project.
